# PyBer_Analysis
## Analysis Over view
Data analyis was performed on data from a ride-sharing app company PyBer in order to establish the differences between location type (urban, suburban and rural) and Fare ($USD). 
## Results
Urban cities are characerized by greater number of total riders and drivers but smaller average fare what was shown by bubble plot.

Urban cities has the highest number of rides, followed by suburban rids and rural cities.

Highest fare median was observed in rural cities followed by subrurban and urban cities.

Urban cities had much higher number of drivers than suburban cities. Rural cities have the lowest number of drivers.

More than half (62.7%) of earned fare by the company come from urban cities.

Most app-asosociated ride are perforemd in urban cities (68.4%)

Majority of drivers using app are from urban cities (80.9%).

Line plot showing Fare in each city type was created for first quater of 2019. Interestingly, there is a clear increase in fares in all city types at the end of February and probable one at the beggining of April. There rest of the quater each city type seems to behave indepedently.

## Summary
Urban cities are characterized by greater number of divers and rides but the average fare is smaller than in rural location. Using rade-sharing app is much more popular in urban cities than rural ones, but in rural cities the fare are higher what is probably associated with longer travel distance. It might be good to increase the populairty of ride sharing in rural location by proper advertisement.
