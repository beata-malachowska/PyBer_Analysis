## Summary
Urban cities are characterized by greater number of divers and rides but the average fare is smaller than in rural location. Using rade-sharing app is much more popular in urban cities than rural ones, but in rural cities the fare are higher what is probably associated with longer travel distance. It might be good to increase the populairty of ride sharing in rural location by proper advertisement.
